# Data Analysis and Power BI Projects

This repository contains four data-related projects, including two Power BI dashboards and two data analysis projects using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Projects

### 1. COVID-19 Real-time Data Dashboard (Power BI)

- **Description:** This Power BI dashboard provides real-time data on COVID-19 cases, sourced from the MyGov website. It offers visualizations and insights to help users track the pandemic's progression.

- **Usage:** To use this dashboard, download the .pbix file and open it with Power BI Desktop. The data source is automatically updated with the latest information from MyGov.

### 2. Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

- **Description:** The Superstore Sales Dashboard is a Power BI visualization of sales data for a fictional superstore. It presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and helps in analyzing sales trends.

- **Usage:** Download the .pbix file and open it with Power BI Desktop to explore sales data, filter by various parameters, and gain insights into store performance.

### 3. Netflix Data Analysis (Python)

- **Description:** This Python project focuses on analyzing Netflix data using Pandas. It explores the content library, genres, and user ratings to uncover trends and insights.

- **Usage:** Refer to the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file for detailed data analysis and visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

### 4. Titanic Survival Analysis (Python)

- **Description:** The Titanic Survival Analysis project uses Python libraries to analyze the Titanic dataset. It investigates passenger demographics, factors affecting survival, and generates predictive models.

- **Usage:** Access the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file to see the data analysis process, machine learning models, and conclusions drawn from the Titanic dataset.
